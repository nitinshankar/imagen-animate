## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run this application and start generating images, you need to configure your Google Gemini API key.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser.
-   A Google Gemini API key.

### Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to communicate with the image generation service.

1.  **Get a Google Gemini API Key:**
    -   Visit the [Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/) website.
    -   Click on **"Get API key in Google AI Studio"** and follow the on-screen instructions to create your key.

2.  **Set up the Environment Variable:**
    -   The application is designed to securely read the API key from an environment variable named `API_KEY`.
    -   How you set this variable depends on your development or deployment environment.

    -   **For Local Development (e.g., using Node.js/Vite):**
        -   Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
        -   Add the following line to your `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the key you just obtained:

        ```env
        API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
        -   **Important:** To keep your API key secure, ensure the `.env` file is never committed to version control. If you are using Git, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

    -   **For Other Platforms/Deployments:**
        -   If you are deploying this to a hosting service (like Vercel, Netlify, or a cloud provider), you will need to set the `API_KEY` environment variable in your service's project settings or configuration panel. Please refer to your hosting provider's documentation for instructions on setting environment variables.

Once the `API_KEY` is correctly configured in your environment, the application will be ready to use.
